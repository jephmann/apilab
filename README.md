# Jeffrey Hartmann's API Lab

## A personal project in constant progress

Here I shall I practice and test various means to access varied API data sources
-- whether via server-side (PHP in this case) or client-side (JavaScript and/or
its frameworks such as AngularJS); whether the data is in JSON, XML or some
other construct.

Look and Feel is the lowest priority in this project. The highest priority in
this project is accessing and displaying API data.

For starters I might access APIs already known to me:

* TheMovieDB
* Weather Undergound
* MeetUp
* City of Chicago (no API key required)
