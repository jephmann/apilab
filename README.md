# Jeffrey Hartmann's API Lab

## A personal project in constant progress, wherein I practice and test various
means to access varied API data sources -- whether via server-side (PHP in this
case) or client-side (JavaScript and/or its frameworks such as AngularJS);
whether the data is in JSON, XML or some other construct.

Look and Feel is the lowest priority in this project. The highest priority in
this project is accessing and displaying API data.
